*A. library in C programming language* 
1.#include <stdio.h>
    its a library for ouput/input like printf, scanf,puts,etc.

2.#include <stdlib.h> — Utility & memory
    this is starting to enter low-level
    like malloc, calloc, realloc, free

3.#include <string.h> — String (char array)
    string.h
    is a standard C library containing functions for managing 
    "strings" (sequences of characters) stored as char arrays and always ending with a 
    null terminator (\0) character. It provides functions such as strcpy (copy), strcat (join), 
    strlen (length), and strcmp (compare) for effectively manipulating text.

4.#include <math.h> — its for math
    math.h
    is a header file in the C language that contains declarations for standard mathematical functions,
    such as square root, exponent, trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), 
    logarithm, rounding, and exponential functions.
    compile = gcc main.c -lm

B.must memorize
1.  a.int -> integer type 
        example: int umur = 18;
    b.float & double -> Decimal numbers
        example: float celcius = 36.5;
                 double pi = 3.1415926535;
    c.char -> 1 char (1byte)
        example: char huruf = 'A';       (with this '' ,not this "" )  
    d.void -> It means not returning anything
        example: void sayHello() {
                    printf("Halo\n");
                }

2. printf = this is important 
  Tipe	    Kode
  int	    %d
  float	    %f
  double	%lf
  char	    %c
  string	%s
  address	%p

example int age = 18;
printf("my age is %d years old\n", age);

3.\n this is like new line(enter)
  so that the code lines are neat
